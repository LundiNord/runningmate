# Running Mate




### Ideas:

- count steps -> calculate cadence

- adapt music to cadence
  - get bpm from spotify: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-analysis
  - get music from sd card

- count distance from steps / calculate step length from gps distance

- calculate calories and other stats (maybe map view)
  - calories: https://fitness.stackexchange.com/questions/15608/energy-expenditure-calories-burned-equation-for-running?newreg=a9c81be5d8e3411a89dc63ba896d98cb
